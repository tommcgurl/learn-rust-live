# Learn Rust Together 🦀📚⚙️λ📹🎙🦀
This is the repo for a live streaming series I'm doing on Twitch.

We will be going through the Rustlang book, [_The Rust Programming Language_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) together.

Join in at https://twitch.tv/tommcgurl on Tuesday nights from **9pm - 11pm** eastern time!

You can view past videos on [My Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJmkfLmcC-1qVW1f9lBAsBA).
